# Roadmap
- [ ] Learn Rust well enough. Resources -> [fasterthanli](<https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust>)
- [ ] Plan the file structure.
- [ ] Implement a 64-bit integer bitboard. (just in case I'll get frustrated -> [Cosmo's squareset](<https://github.com/cosmobobak/viridithas/blob/master/src/chess/squareset.rs>))
      
Project Start along with learning Rust -> 25.06.2025

# Early expectations
 * Surpassing SF 8 by the end of the summer.
 * Try to get competitive vs [Clockwork](<https://github.com/official-clockwork/clockwork>) over the time.

# Goals of the project
 * A significant aim of this project is to serve a high-quality, documented Rust chess engine codebase.
 * Surpassing Stockfish Classical
 * Ideally go into NNUE after accomplishing the second goal.
