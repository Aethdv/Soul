Started Learning Rust -> 26.06.2025

## Roadmap
- [ ] Learn Rust well enough. Resources I've touched -> [fasterthanli](<https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust>)
- [X] Plan the file structure.
- [ ] Implement a 64-bit integer bitboard. (just in case I'll get frustrated -> [Cosmo's squareset](<https://github.com/cosmobobak/viridithas/blob/master/src/chess/squareset.rs>))
- [ ] Pseudo-legal movegen
- [ ] 16-bit move encoding
- [ ] Basic perft

#### Just so I remember
- Look into [87flowers's](<https://github.com/87flowers>) [byteboard attack table](<https://87flowers.com/byteboard-attack-tables-1/>) implementation **(AVX512)**. [AVX2 support](<https://github.com/official-clockwork/Clockwork/commit/5a8a38afed3b15a23059efb25dd4ed3547775e3e>)
- [Bitboard Viewer](<https://tearth.dev/bitboard-viewer/>)

#### Goals of the project
 * A significant aim of this project is to serve a high-quality, documented Rust chess engine codebase.
 * Surpassing Stockfish Classical
 * Try to get competitive vs [Clockwork](<https://github.com/official-clockwork/clockwork>).
 * Ideally go into NNUE after accomplishing the second goal and third goal.

#### Thanks,
- [Cosmo](<https://github.com/cosmobobak>) for helping me start learning Rust and wrap my head around this.
